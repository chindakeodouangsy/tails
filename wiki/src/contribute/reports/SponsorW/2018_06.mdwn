# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We created merge requests and worked with upstream on our patches to add
VeraCrypt support to the various GNOME components which are involved in
unlocking volumes using *GNOME Files*
([glib](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/merge_requests/120),
[GVfs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/merge_requests/4), and [GNOME
Shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/merge_requests/126)).

## A.7 Write user documentation

We wrote a [first draft of the
documentation](https://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt.mdwn?h=doc/14476-veracrypt)
and tested it during the user testing.

We identified serious issues in the structure and navigation of this
draft and fixed them.

## A.8 User testing & community feedback

We conducted a user testing of a development version of the VeraCrypt
feature.

We organized an in-person moderated user testing with five participants.
We recruited participants who are in the target audience for this
feature: people who had tried Tails a few times but who were not expert
users. None of them were used to VeraCrypt which made the tasks a bit
harder for them but didn't result being very problematic in itself.

The tests were less successful than that ones we did for the Additional
Software feature in May. All participants had to turn to the
documentation to fulfill the missions and, even after that, two
participants failed in some of the missions.

The average SUS score is of 50 which is considered below average
compared to other industry products and qualified as "OK".

The most critical issue was the lack of discoverability: how to get
started with unlocking a VeraCrypt volume in the first place. Due to a
lack of time on our side, the development version that we used for the
tests didn't include the [[*VeraCrypt Mounter*|blueprint/veracrypt#veracrypt_mounter]]
utility that we designed in December.

We are confident that, after adding *VeraCrypt Mounter* ([[!tails_ticket
15043]]) and fixing the navigation issues in the documentation
([[!tails_ticket 15670]]), the usability of this feature will be better
than average.

A more detailed report was sent to our UX mailing list:

The full results are available in on UX Git repo (OTS spreadsheet):

## A.9 Fix bugs and UX issues

We started fixing various issues that were discovered during the user
testing ([[!tails_ticket 15419]]).

This includes the implementation of *VeraCrypt Mounter* ([[!tails_ticket
15043]]).

# B. Additional software

## B.8 Fix bugs and UX issues

We prioritized the issues identified during the user testing that we
conducted in May based on a value/cost metrics and started fixing them
by order of priority.
