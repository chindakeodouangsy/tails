This report covers the activity of Tails in May 2018.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.5 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Disks

Our merge request has been
[accepted](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-disk-utility/issues/84#note_222551)
upstream, so this deliverable is now completed.

## A.10 Port to the latest version of GNOME

We backported our glib, GTK+, GVfs, and GNOME Shell patches to the
version we use in Tails and created Debian packages to use in Tails
([#15521](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15521#note-4)).

# B. Additional software

## B.6 User documentation

We wrote a first draft of the documentation and it was tested during the
user testing.

## B.7 Beta release, user testing & community feedback

We [[published a beta version of the Additional Software feature and asked
users to test it|news/test_asp-beta]]. Bugs and remarks from testers have
been collected on our bug tracker in order to improve the implementation
of the Additional Software feature [[!tails_ticket 15567]].

We also conducted and completed a user testing of the beta version.

To this end, we organized an in-person moderated user testing with five
participants. We recruited participants who are in the target audience
for this feature: people who had tried Tails a few times but who were
not expert users.

The interface that we designed in January worked really well. Only one
participant had a very bad time and failed some of the missions.

Most issues are around the interface itself: they are integration issues
or issues in other parts of Tails, in GNOME, or in the navigation on our
website and documentation.

The average SUS score is of 68 which is considered right on average
compared to other industry products.
