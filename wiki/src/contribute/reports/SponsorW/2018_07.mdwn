# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We continued working with GNOME upstream on our many merge requests related to unlocking VeraCrypt volumes in *GNOME Files*:

* <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/merge_requests/4> (merged)
* <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/merge_requests/120> (merged)

## A.8 User testing & community feedback

We released a beta version and called for testing on Twitter, on our
blog and on our testers mailing list. Then we started collecting
feedback. Based on this feedback, UX designers and developers will
prioritize and fix as many issues as possible within the
allocated budget.

## A.9 Fix bugs and UX issues

We made many improvements and fixed issues that were discovered during the user testing or were reported by testers of the beta, most notably:

* Extend *VeraCrypt Mounter* and made it the default handler of VeraCrypt file containers ([[!tails_ticket 15664#note-16]])

* Improve the *VeraCrypt Mounter* UI and icon ([[!tails_ticket 15043]] [[!tails_ticket 15680]])

* Show a spinner in the places sidebar of GNOME Files during unlock operations ([[!tails_ticket 15664]])

* Extend the GTK ask-password dialog to support VeraCrypt options ([[!tails_ticket 15667]])

# B. Additional software

## B.6 Write user documentation

We've worked on the user documentation for the Additional Software
feature and completed most of it ([[!tails_ticket 14589]]). There are some
remaining subtasks needing work, we are confident that we'll be able to
publish the documentation along with the Tails 3.9 release.

## B.8 Fix bugs and UX issues

We made progress on improving on many and fixing some of the bugs
identified by our user testing ([[!tails_ticket 15567]]).

# C. Deliver new features

Our entire team kept coordinating their work in order to ensure we
merge these new features in Tails 3.9~rc1 and deliver them in TailsÂ 3.9.
