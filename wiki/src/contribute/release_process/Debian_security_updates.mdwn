We don't want to release Tails ISO's and learn 2 days later about
important security issues fixed by Debian security updates. The
following set of tools should be enough to avoid such bad timing, e.g.
by delaying a Tails release a bit to wait for a DSA to happen.

Debian security team
====================

Security tracker
----------------

The Debian [security tracker][web]'s [GIT repository][git] is the main
place where Debian tracks the status of security issues.

We can look at the [list of upcoming Debian Security Advisories (DSA)][DSA needed].

There is also a [mailing list][] that broadcasts changes to
this repository.
