[[!meta title="Documentation style guide"]]

- **bulleted lists**

  Refer to this article from NN/g on [presenting bulleted
  lists](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/presenting-bulleted-lists/).

- **Debian and Ubuntu versions**

  Refer to Debian and Ubuntu versions primarily by their numbers, and additionally
  by their codenames.

  * *For example*:
    - Tails 3.0 is based on Debian 9 (Stretch)
    - *Tails Installer* is available on Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) or later.

<a id="digit_grouping"></a>

- **digit grouping**

  Use a non-breaking thin space (HTML entity: `&#8239;`) or a space to separate
  groups of three digits.

  * *For example*:
    - $50&#8239;000

  See [[!wikipedia Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping]] and [[!wikipedia
  ISO_31-0#Numbers]].

<a id="gnome_application"></a>

- **GNOME applications: <i>Files</i>, <i>Disks</i>, etc.**

  GNOME applications that have a common noun as their name (like
  <span class="application">Files</span> or
  <span class="application">Disks</span>) can be confusing when referred
  to in the documentation.

  Make sure to clarify that you are referring to an application (and
  not, for example, a set of files or disks):

  - *For example*:
    - In the title of sections
    - When first referring to the application in a section

  - *Use*:
    - The <span class="application">Files</span> browser
    - The <span class="application">Disks</span> utility

  Otherwise, use the short name of the application as it appears in the menus when giving
  instructions to be executed inside Tails.

  - *For example*:
    - Open */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles* in *Files*.

  Prepend "*GNOME*" when giving instructions to be executed outside of
  Tails.

  - *For example*:
    - Install <span class="application">GNOME Disks</span> in Debian.

- **graphics card**

  And not *graphics adapters*, *graphics*, *graphical hardware*, or
  *video card*.

- **procedures** (a series of steps)

  - Keep the number of steps low within a procedure (for example, below
    10, ideally 7). For longer procedures, split them and give each
    section a title.

  - Add a blank line between each step.

  - Rely on the automatic numbered of Markdown and number all the steps
    with `1.`

  See also the *Microsoft Manual of Style: Procedures and technical
  content*.

  *For example*:

<pre>
1. Make sure that you are connected to the Internet.

1. Start <span class="application">Software Sources</span>.

1. Click on the <span class="guilabel">PPAs</span> button and then choose to <span class="button">Add a new PPA&hellip;</span>.
</pre>

- **network interface**, **Wi-Fi interface**

  And not *card*, *device*, or *adapter*.

  Still, **USB Wi-Fi adapters** are USB dongles that provide a Wi-Fi interface.

- **persistence feature**

  To refer to the features available in the configuration of the
  *persistent storage*.

  - *For example*: when the [[<span class="guilabel">Additional
    Software</span> persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] is activated.

  The word *persistence* can be omitted if it is redundant from the context
  (for example on [[doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]]).

- **serial comma**

  Place a [[!wikipedia serial comma]] immediately before the
  coordinating conjunction (usually *and* or *or*) in a series of three
  or more terms.

- **startup options**

  To refer to the kernel command line options that can be specified from
  the *Boot Loader Menu*.

  * *For example:* Adding `radeon.dpm=0` to the [[startup
    options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

- **<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>**

  Without an article. Not *the Greeter*. Note the formatting as an application.
