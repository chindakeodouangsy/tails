# Gather comments on our draft personas

Chapter 3: [[Riou, the protest organizer|personas#riou]]

- Servers and censorship
  - *u: In order to publish this information they use websites which are
    not in the country, so that the government cannot shut them down. →
    we should write "not hosted on servers within the country"*
  - *u: Although they take photos and videos of the protests and try to
    publish this information on websites which are censored within the
    country.  → this sentence is a bit unclear*

- Country & context
  - *groente: i find it hard to comment because i know close to nothing
    about the local context there*
  - *groente: i would argue for choosing another country where we do
    actually know the local context and can make a realistic persona*
  - *groente: idk, sofar it reads rather emea-minded (Europe &
    Middle-East)*
  - *sajolida: maybe i should have a look at a list of hard-core
    censorship countries or ask OONI for countries/contextes and maybe
    even contacts*
  - *groente: would turkey be a good alternative?*
  - *sajolida: Iran would be another easy choice*
  - *u: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Iranian_protests
    or this*

- Umbrella movement
  - *sajolida: by the way, is the Umbrella movement still a thing?
    should we made it more movement-agnostic?*
  - *u: no it's not a thing anymore*

- Streaming
  - *u: They got to get it online as soon as it's produced on sociadia
    and they also want to stream the protest and speeches.  → They got
    to get it online and on social media as soon as it's produced. They
    also want to stream the protest and speeches.*
  - *emmapeel: this picture taking and streaming sounds a bit
    temerarious i think....*
  - *nodens: "They also want to stream the protest and speeches" ->
    isn't "stream" a bit misleading ? I doubt they'd try to do it live
    (if they want to do that, that would probably be both difficult and
    risky)*
  - *u: maybe "record" and later publish would be better*
  - *nodens: (the "record then publish" doesn't change the goal)*

- Device during the protest
  - *emmapeel: yes yes i see riou could do with a little hideout with
    good connection, where the protestors will go ad give their memory
    cards.*
  - *sajolida: it's unclear to me with what device their take pictures
    and record, since they also leave their phones at home: are they
    using dedicates phone? other people's phone? offline cameras?*
  - *u: yeah maybe we need to say that they actually do use their phones
    or that they use a video camera*
  - *nodens: I would say any of those three, I don't think this has any
    influence on the challenges - or rather, the challenges seem
    irrelevant in tails context*
  - *emmapeel: maybe riou wants to have some hidden camera o their
    clothing*

- Work before and after the protest
  - *sajolida: so their work with Tails could only occur before or after
    the protests, right?*
  - *u: yes, or in some press center*
  - *sajolida: so maybe we should get into more details regarding the
    preparation and follow up of the protest, and leave aside the
    technical details of their opsec during the protest, no?*
  - *u: sajolida: like at G20 people had such a press center → but this
    event would be too controversial to make into a persona*
  - *emmapeel: riou eeds backups too, for the team to share the
    different pictures like a mediagoblin or something*
  - *emmapeel: if the organizers communicate stealthily, maybe they can
    share the pictures with onionshare*
  - *emmapeel: maybe they have one of those canon cameras with hacked
    firmware and can encrypt the pictures when they are taken, just i
    case they get caught*

- Help other with censorship
  - *nodens: maybe another goal: "I want people to be able to easily
    access censored information" ? Or is that not part of the persona ?*
  - *sajolida: i think that Riou might be the kind of person has also
    helps other access censored information*
  - *nodens: the phrasing would probably need to be refined but the idea
    is that it is probably important for Kim that people in her/his
    county can read the infromation*
  - *sajolida: at least they are trying to spread censored information
    within their country*
  - *sajolida: so maybe Riou gives out Tails sticks during the
    protest!!*
  - *nodens: yeah or advertises about Tails at least*
  - *nodens: or organises workshops during the protest :D*
  - *sajolida: or gives out outreach material or translate Tails into
    their language, etc.*
  - *nodens: (but that would be probably dangerous too. You don't want
    to bring a laptop to this protest I guess)*
  - *groente: maybe riou runs a clandestine private bridge and wants to
    share this with fellow protesters?*
  - *nodens: also, printed material (user manual for instance)*
  - *nodens: Oh I got a new one - "I want to know which websites are
    censored in country" (a job for ONII Probe)*

- Technical level
  - *emmapeel: mahybe she is studying computer science*
  - *u: normal → power user i think*
  - *u: yeah, they are the more techie ones i think and have had a blog
    before and used twitter*
  - *sajolida: Riou look like one of these people we meet at the IFF,
    well versed in anti-censorship tools and advocacy but without being
    a Linux hacker either*
  - *emmapeel: riou will have a mac then! :S*
  - *sajolida: and likes glitter*
  - *u: and a apfelphone :)*
  - *nodens: "I want to be able to type without external keyboard on my
    Mac computer while using tails" ? ;)*

- Relationship with the press
  - *sajolida: does Riou work with journalists in their country? or the
    "we do our stuff and never talk to the press" kind of protesters?*
  - *nodens: I'd say Riou might want to communicate anonymously with the
    press*
  - *groente: answering that really requires knowledge of the local
    context*
  - *sajolida: are they only pushing stuff to the press or are they
    collaborating more with them?*
  - *u: i think they work with journalists. but if that protest was the
    G20 or some anticoal event in Germany, they would not*
  - *emmapeel: i think riou and her comrades should create a fictional
    character that talks with the press*
  - *emmapeel: maybe they work with international journalists, like from
    the guardian but not the ones in HongKong*

- Resources
  - *groente: i can ask the folks at hivos/ddp if they have any contacts
    in hong kong that could have a look at the persona*
