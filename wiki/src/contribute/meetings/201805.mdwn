Chapter 1: [[Kim, the surveilled at home|blueprint/personas#kim]]

- Windows camouflage
  - *emmapeel: kim would have liked windows camouflage*

- Institutionalized
  - *u: "that has been institutionalized" -> do you mean s/he has been in psychiatry ?*
  - *emmapeel: i think in this context institutionalized could also be
    on an orphanage*

- Bitcoin
  - *emmapeel: to have his own savings outside of the institution*
  - *emmapeel: its on my private idaho*
  - *emmapeel: specially if kim is underage, they are not going to let
    him handle his savings*

- Alison
  - Ask Alison from Tor about the story she told emmapeel and sajolida.

- Feeling normal
  - *masha: I dislike the "Kim wants to feel normal", I'd rather put
    "feel safe"*
  - *masha: well, when you're queer of color, you're not "normal" and
    the world reminds you every day, so what you want is the end of
    homophobia/racism for example. And the "want to be normal" might
    merge with being invisible, and put everything too queer being
    closed doors.*
  - *masha: maybe the point is that "normal" leaves way too much room
    for interpretation*

- Homeless
  - *emmapeel: i just want to say that a very high percentage of
    homeless youth in the world is queer. they get kicked out from home
    for being queer*
  - *emmapeel: but the gay kids go on the streets and they get
    institutionalized*

- Computer room
  - *u: i think the Kim persona sounds very stressful (limited time,
    mentor surveillance...). and surveilled at home can be much less
    extreme than this case.*
  - *u: i think for example the fact that the computer room is crowded
    is an extra stress factor which we could make a bit less extreme by
    writing "the computer room is sometimes croweded"*
  - *sajolida: an option would be to add that they sometimes also borrow
    the computer of a trusted friend inside the institution*
  - *u: that could be an option (trusted friend's computer)*
  - *emmapeel: if kim has no computer, and uses a computer of a friend,
    is good to have tails...*

- Too many threats
  - *u: Kim's case has two angles: the surveillance at home by mentors
    and peers, and the sharia in nigeria as well as internet censorship*
  - *u: sajolida: so kim's case actually has three angles and if we
    would replace kim by someone who lives with their abuser, there
    would not be the whole censorship and legal part*
  - *u: i could imagine to have one person who is either
    institutionalized or living with their abuser and one gay youth in
    nigeria, but not necessarily under surveillance at home*
  - *sajolida: u: if we keep a gay youth in Nigeria who is not
    instituationalized, their issues would be censorship circumvention,
    State surveillance, and identity management, right?*
  - *sajolida: then it would look very much like Riou*
  - *emmapeel: yeah maybe he could have a blog....*
  - *sajolida: but maybe you're right and we should refocus Kim to be
    more strongly about surveillance at home and not so much about other
    things as well*
  - *sajolida: so remove their societal and State oppression and stick to
    the domestic oppression*

- Religious family
  - *sajolida: Kim could be gay in a super religious US family for
    example*
  - *u: fine with me, yes, gay/trans in a religious family in any
    fanatic religious family.*

- Transsexual
  - *spriver: (how about transsexual, that'd be me)*
  - *emmapeel: yeah if you are trans you also have to get out*
