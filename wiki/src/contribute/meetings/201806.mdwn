# Volunteers to handle "Hole in the roof" tickets this month

Nope.

# Volunteers to handle important tickets flagged for next release, but without assignee

There's none.

# Availability and plans until the next meeting

- intrigeri:
  - availability: ~half time or slightly more.
  - plans: keep the FT boat afloat, RM 3.8, finish my ASP
    deliverables, stay on top of the VeraCrypt project since I'm now
    more involved than I used to.
- sajolida:
  - availability: "Full" expect June 11-15.
  - plans: User testing for VeraCrypt, bug fixing for Additional
    Software, kickoff the collaboration with Simply Secure, hopefully
    do some work on donations ([[!tails_ticket 14558]],
    [[!tails_ticket 14559]]).
- spriver: Translation platform, German translations
- u: I will do some Tails work this month: translation platform, an
  important accounting meeting, Debian work. Otherwise I want to
  continue work on another project.

# Strategic planning: Containers/separated identities without rebooting

We brainstormed why this could be a relevant goal:

 - Even if we claim we don't support this, for many reasons users do
   it anyway.
 - Making it easier to switch between one's "regular" identity
   (outside of Tails) and a "secret" one (in Tails) was mentioned in
   user interviews. But "without rebooting" is too limiting as there
   may be other solutions to this problem.
 - Such a feature would be very innovative.
 - This feature could encourage people to use more
   contextual identities.
 - Having to maintain multiple persistent configurations for multiple
   contextual identities is time-consuming, when most of the
   configuration (except identity-specific data) is common to all
   of them.

And then we brainstormed why this should not be a goal:

 - Perhaps this is not the best solution to the problems this solution
   would solve: having Tails running on cheap tablets, or booting
   faster, or being able to hibernate and resume quickly could achieve
   similar results.
 - The main problem is to better support switching between the real
   world and Tails (2 identities). Supporting 3 or more would only be
   a slight improvement.
 - This solution requires a full redesign of Tails, its
   implementation, how it presents itself to the user, etc. and the
   cost/benefit is not worth is.

And then we reached a consensus among the attendees: we drop this as
a goal but we replace it with a new one that is "make it easier to
switch between a Tails contextual identity and another identity
outside of Tails".
