[[!meta title="Encrypted persistence"]]

If you start Tails from a USB stick, you can create a
persistent volume in the free space left on the USB stick by <span
class="application">Tails Installer</span>. The files in the persistent
volume are saved encrypted and remain available across separate working sessions.

<div class="note">

<p>It is only possible to create a persistent volume if the USB stick
was installed using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>.</p>

<p>This requires a USB stick of <strong>at least 8 GB</strong>.</p>

</div>

You can use this persistent volume to store any of the following:

  - Personal files
  - Some settings
  - Additional software
  - Encryption keys

The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.
