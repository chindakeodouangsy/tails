OpenPGP encryption with Enigmail
================================

<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails includes the
<span class="application">[Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/)</span>
extension to encrypt and authenticate emails using OpenPGP.

To configure <span class="application">Enigmail</span> for your email account, you can start the
<span class="application">Enigmail Setup Wizard</span> by choosing
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Enigmail</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Setup Wizard</span></span>.

You can also create an OpenPGP key associated with your email address as
part of the <span class="application">Enigmail Setup Wizard</span>.

If you are new to OpenPGP, you can read the following guides on getting
started with encrypting emails using
<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> and

Enhanced privacy with TorBirdy
==============================

<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails includes the
<span class="application">[TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy)</span>
extension for additional privacy and anonymity.

<li>Automatic checking of Atom and RSS feeds on startup.</li>
</ul>
