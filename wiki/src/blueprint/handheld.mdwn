Generic
-------

* Minimized applications in the taskbar can't be raised via the
  taskbar. They can be raised via the *Activities Overwiew*.

Toshiba Encore 2 WT8-B
----------------------

* Intel Atom CPU Z3735F @ 1.33GHz (Bay Trail)
* can cold-boot from USB: hold down the Vol+ button, then hold down
  the Power button, until the boot selection menu appears.
  Select the desired boot device and press the Windows key.

### Tails pre-3.9 devel branch (Stretch) + feature/15763-linux-4.17

* MAC spoofing fails
* Backlight tuning: GNOME Shell offers the UI, but it has no visible effect.
* Display rotation (probably because we don't install `iio-sensor-proxy`)
* Sound card is detected but no sound output. The kernel complains
  about missing `intel/fw_sst_0f28.bin` firmware while it's supposed
  to be shipped in [[!debpts firmware-intel-sound]].
  <http://www.studioteabag.com/science/dell-venue-pro-linux/#ALSA> has
  some configuration tricks that might help.

### feature/jessie + 32-bit UEFI, 20150507

* The Florence virtual keyboard is not very usable:
  - its default font size is way too small, but that can be configured
  - its "systray" icon is too small to be clicked, so one can't toggle
    the virtual keyboard on/off; see [[!tails_ticket 8312]]
* Wi-Fi
* Battery level monitoring: GNOME Shell always says 100%.
* Backlight tuning: GNOME Shell offers the UI, but it has no effect
  that I can perceive.
* Tor Browser 4.5 [[!tor_bug 15953 desc="does a weird resizing dance on startup"]].
* Sound card not detected (`/proc/asound/cards`), although a bunch of
  `snd_soc_*` kernel modules are loaded. Logs complain about missing
  `fw_sst_0f28.bin-i2s_master` firmware. Looks like [[!debbug 774914]]
  or <https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2254631> that suggests
  to fetch the firmware from the Chrome OS repository. Other sources
  suggest that the DSDT may be buggy.

Works fine

Toshiba Encore 2
----------------

### Tails pre-3.9 devel branch (Stretch) + feature/15763-linux-4.17

* _sometimes_ boots fine after:
  - removing `slab_nomerge`, `slub_debug=FZP`, `vsyscall=none`, `page_poison=1`,
    `quiet` and `splash` → XXX: which of these changes are are really needed?
  - adding `nosplash` → XXX: really needed?
  - adding `clocksource=tsc tsc=reliable` → XXX: really needed?
  - `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` (<https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109051>) → XXX: really needed?
* Battery level monitoring

### feature/jessie + 32-bit UEFI, 20150507

* boots fine with `nomodeset` (otherwise screen blanks at `switching
  to inteldrmfb from simplefb`, although the OS continues loading)
* X.Org with KMS
* touchscreen
* USB
