Releases
========

* [[Tails VERSION was released on MONTH DAY|news/version_VERSION]] ([major|minor] release).

* Tails VERSION+1 is [[scheduled for MONTH DAY|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails VERSION:

XXX: Copy the "Changes" section of the release notes, and compact a bit:

* Remove lines about software upgrade (that's not Tails itself).
* Remove screenshots.
* Remove "New features" and "Upgrades and changes" headlines.
* Remove line about Changelog.

Code
====

XXX: If you feel like it and developers don't do it themselves,
     list important code work that is not covered already by the
     Release section (for example, the changes being worked on for
     the next version).

- We have worked on improving support for recent graphics cards and in
  particular those produced by NVIDIA. We've sent
  a [call for testing](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2018-June/001018.html)
  and
  [updated](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2018-June/001029.html)
  it. If the feedback is good, we will probably include these changes
  in Tails 3.9.

- We have kept working on fixing the EFAIL attacks against
  encrypted email ([[!tails_ticket 15602]]). Tails 3.8 fixed most of
  them and Tails 3.9 should fix the remaining ones.

- We have worked on detecting earlier changes that would break
  automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 15419]])â€¦ and already identified
  one we need to fix in time for Tails 3.9 ([[!tails_ticket 15695]]).

- Chris Lamb prepared a fix for the most infamous rendering issue (raw PO
  content being inserted in some page) that affects our website
  ([[!tails_ticket 6907]]).
